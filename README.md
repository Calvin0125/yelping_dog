The goal of this project is to create a mock website for a local business. The business I have chosen is Yelping Dog Wine in Staunton, VA, because I used to work there and they do not currently have a website. Once completed, there should be a home page with photos of the restaurant/bar and short descriptions of what they offer, an about page with text and a couple photos, a page with menus, and a page with events. Every page should have a footer that shows the hours, location, contact info, and social media links. The website will also have the capability for the owner to log in and make changes since the wines would need to be updated weekly. In addition, the website will be connected to a database where events can be stored, so that visitors to the site can see a history of past events as well as upcoming events. This project is not sponsored by the business, but I will donate the completed website to them if they choose to use it. The photos currently in use are not my own, and in the event that the business chooses to use this page the pictures will be replaced with pictures given to me by the business owner.
